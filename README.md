## Create a Token
This Solidity program is a contract that creates an Token and sent to users/addresses. This is my Metacrafters ETH Beginner Final Project

# Description
This program is a smart contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has 6 functions, i.e. Mint, Burn and 4 Getter functions. By using the mint function we can add more tokens to the total supply and send tokens to address and by using the burn function we can remove the tokens from total supply and also remove it from the address. I have also added a check measure where if the current balance of the user is less than the amount that is entered to be burned the transaction will fail

# Executing program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., ETH_Token.sol). 
Copy and paste the following code into the file
